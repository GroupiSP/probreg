    """Train a single NNX model for a fixed or early-stopped number of epochs.

    The runner does not restore the best checkpoint: when training ends,
    ``model`` holds the parameters of the last epoch run. To continue from the
    best model, load the checkpoint from ``checkpoint_store`` and pass it to
    [`restore_checkpoint`][probreg.jax.restore_checkpoint].

    Args:
        model: The NNX module to train, mutated in place.
        optimizer: The NNX optimizer used to update ``model``, mutated
            in place.
        train_loader: Factory producing the training batch loader for a
            given split and epoch.
        loss: A callable computing the supervised loss given a model,
            inputs, targets, sample weights, a PRNG key, and a
            ``training`` flag.
        state: The training state to update in place across epochs.
        epochs: The maximum number of epochs to run.
        validation: An optional strategy used to evaluate ``state``
            after each epoch. Required if ``early_stopper`` monitors a
            validation metric.
        early_stopper: An optional policy that stops training early
            based on a monitored training or validation metric.
        event_sinks: Sinks notified of epoch, validation, best-model,
            and early-stop events.
        checkpoint_store: An optional store used to persist the best
            checkpoint when ``early_stopper`` reports an improvement.
        checkpoint_key: The checkpoint key under which the best checkpoint
            is saved. Defaults to ``None``, which resolves to the stage-scoped
            key ``f"{stage}/best"`` so that stages sharing one
            ``checkpoint_store`` never overwrite each other; the
            [`MeanStage`][probreg.jax.MeanStage] and
            [`GammaVarianceStage`][probreg.jax.GammaVarianceStage] defaults
            resolve the same way.
        stage: The stage name recorded on ``state`` and emitted events,
            and the stage segment of every metric tag recorded in
            ``state.metric_history``. Defaults to ``"supervised"``.
        model_name: Name under which ``model`` is registered in ``state``.
            Defaults to ``"model"``.
        optimizer_name: Name under which ``optimizer`` is registered in
            ``state``. Defaults to ``"optimizer"``.
        metrics: Optional registered batch/epoch metrics for training. When
            omitted, only loss is collected.

    Returns:
        A [`StageResult`][probreg.core.StageResult] with the final
        ``state``, the last recorded training metrics under their bare
        names, and the final training loss. ``state.metric_history``
        records every metric under its metric tag ``stage/split/metric``.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``epochs`` is not positive, if ``stage`` is empty
            or contains ``/``, if ``early_stopper`` monitors a validation
            metric without a ``validation`` strategy, or if the monitored
            metric is not produced by training or validation.
