"""End-to-end CMAPSS FD001 two-stage probabilistic RUL training and evaluation.

Loads the FD001 training and test splits, builds standardized sliding
windows, and trains a two-stage probabilistic pipeline through `probreg`'s
explicit supervised stages:

* Stage 1 trains a deterministic 1D-CNN mean model via `MeanStage`.
* Stage 2 trains an independently-initialized 1D-CNN Gamma model on the
  frozen Stage-1 model's squared residuals via `GammaVarianceStage`.

The frozen Stage-1 point prediction and the Stage-2 Gamma mean are then
combined into a composite `Gaussian` predictive distribution, evaluated
end to end against the official FD001 test split with `probreg`'s
`MetricSuite`/`GaussianPredictor`/`evaluate_loader` machinery, reporting
RMSE, 95% interval coverage, and point-CRPS. The test split follows a
single-window-per-trajectory protocol: one window per test unit, ending at
its last observed (possibly truncated) cycle, scored against that unit's
ground-truth RUL from `RUL_FD001.txt`.

Run it with:

    uv run --group example-cmapss python examples/jax/cmapss/run.py
