# AGENTS.md

`probreg` is a Python library for stage-oriented probabilistic regression, with a JAX/Flax
backend and runnable examples under `examples/jax/`.

## Environment

The package manager is **`uv`**, not pip. Every Python command runs through it: `uv run pytest`,
`uv run pre-commit run --all-files`. Dev setup is `uv sync --extra jax --group dev --group docs`
then `uv run pre-commit install`. The `jax` extra is required because `uv run pytest` also runs the
snippets in `README.md` and `docs_site/`, which import JAX, Flax and Optax; the docs site
(`docs_site/`, built by `mkdocs.yml`) needs the `docs` group as well. Examples have their own dependency groups (`example-cmapss`,
`example-tracking`); install one with `uv sync --group <name>`.

## Verification gate

Before presenting changes for review, all four must pass:

- `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` (ruff check, ruff format, docformatter)
- `uv run pytest` (also runs the Python snippets in `README.md` and `docs_site/`)
- `uv run --extra jax --group docs mkdocs build --strict` (the docs site in `docs_site/`)
- A smoke test of the entry points under `examples/jax/` that your change could affect.

Answer concisely. Reach for a table, diagram, code snippet or worked example when prose alone
would not carry the point — not by default.
