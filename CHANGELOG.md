[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- `TrainingState.active_stage` is now a dataclass field. The `TrainingState.stage`
  field, which the `active_stage` property used to wrap, is removed; pass and read
  `active_stage` instead.
- `Checkpoint.rng_state` is removed. A checkpoint's random key lives only in
  `Checkpoint.state.rng_state`, and restores read it from there.
- `TrainingState.outer_iteration` and `TrainingState.data_fingerprint` are removed.
  Nothing in the library populated them.
- `TrainingEvent.iteration` is removed. It always reported `0`, as no run has outer
  iterations yet.

### Added

- `stagereg.core.expected_sample_crps(predictive_samples, reference_samples)`: the
  exact, grid-free expected CRPS of each scoring unit's empirical predictive under
  its reference samples, batched over units.

### Changed
