# Changelog

All notable changes to `stagereg` are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking changes

- `InferenceMethod` requires a `diagnostics` property; a custom method
  declares `()` to keep recording only its loss (#106).

### Added

- `PosteriorProblem.aleatoric_variance`: the fixed, stop-gradient aleatoric
  variance a `PosteriorStage` uses for its likelihood, so an implicit method
  can turn draws into predictive samples. Optional for hand-built problems (#106).
- `InferenceMethod.diagnostics`: the keys of `update`'s output that
  `PosteriorStage` records as `posterior/train/<key>` epoch means. Undeclared
  keys are ignored; a key colliding with a recorded tag is refused at `prepare`.
  `BayesByBackprop` and `PreconditionedSGLD` declare `()` (#106).
- `stagereg.core.expected_sample_crps(predictive_samples, reference_samples)`: the
  exact, grid-free expected CRPS of each scoring unit's empirical predictive under
  its reference samples, batched over units.
